## deploy/joystickprofiles

This directory contains profiles for the controller joysticks. They can be generated using the `JoystickProfiler` class.

Joystick profiles are stored as an array of polar coordinates (stored as a tuple), from -π to π. The theta value represents the heading of the joystick, and the r value describes the norm of the joystick.
